          PART is a multi-purpose utility coin which has many uses within the Particl economy. It can be used as a privacy coin, but most importantly is required to use the Particl platform's features and decentralized applications such as the marketplace, voting and messaging, only to name a few. The PART coin is also used to secure the Particl network through Particl Proof-of-Stake and gives stakers a minimum yearly staking interest of 5%.
