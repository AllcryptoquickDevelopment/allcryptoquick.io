Capitalizing on the latest Bitcoin codebase not only allows the Particl platform to benefit from both Bitcoin’s stability and security, but also enables developers to leverage and easily fork any product, service and technology development from the Bitcoin developer community.

                                                    Particl Cold Staking is enabled by smart-contract functionality and lets users securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes” which contain no coin. The purpose of these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the Particl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to spend its coins. In other words, it allows users to stake offline coins.

                                                    In the spirit of connecting many different crypto communities together, the Particl platform is designed in such a way that it can accept almost any currency using atomic swaps and third-party integrations. However, as the platform (marketplace, extended messaging, future Dapps, etc) requires PART to function in a private way (CT and RingCT), all incoming currency transactions are automatically converted into PART.
