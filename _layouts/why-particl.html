                          Particl's mission is to empower society by fostering a new decentralized, private and democratic economy supported by its blockchain platform. This new alternative economy allows people to both earn and spend money in a completely trustless fashion as well as use and build decentralized applications that respect their rights to privacy.

                          The state of the debt-based world economy as it is today isn't rewarding for most individuals on the planet. The people have seen their purchasing and democratic powers slowly erode over time and be transfered over to a select number of powerful entities. We at Particl believe in a different world, one without middlemen or central authority and where the power is restored back to the people.

                        <h2>Open-Source</h2>
			<p class="small">Following the lead of Bitcoin, Particl advocates for an open source policy.  Open source projects have positive effects when it comes to sustainability as it embraces and celebrates principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, peer-reviewing, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.
                          This aspect of the protocol gives users and programmers the ability to inspect, modify and enhance the source code, and finally build on top of it.

                        <h2>Secure</h2>
			<p class="small">The Particl developing team takes its users' security extremely seriously as reflected by the many layers of security protecting the Particl platformâ€™s users. Whether it be securing stakers' funds through cold staking or keeping marketplace users' identity and data safe from malicious actors, the Particl platform is designed with security at its core and makes no compromise about it.</p>

                        <h2>Private by Design</h2>
			<p class="small">Particl's decentralized marketplace is completely private by design, meaning that no transaction can be tracked back to a user. This approach is prefered as the behavior of a blockchain is to record all transactions for ever, opening up a lot of opportunities for third-parties to abuse that data. The various attacks aimed at personal data such as its collection for commercial purposes, theft or surveillance are thwarted by Particl's many privacy protocols.</p>

                        <h2>Decentralized</h2>
			<p class="small">The Particl economy is one that is decentralized, private and democratic. We believe many sectors can be improved and rendered more efficient by being designed in a decentralized fashion. Fees can be enormely reduced and no trust to central authority or party is required, making activities within the platform more cost-efficient, private and secure. Furthermore, the platform's resilience to attacks is greatly improved as the only way to shut it down is to shut down the internet completely.

                        <h2>Crypto-agnostic</h2>
			<p class="small">Particl is currency-agnostic. In common language, it means it is designed to work with almost any cryptocurrency. As such, we welcome all other crypto communities to begin spending their favorite coin on the Particl platform and benefit from its privacy, security and decentralized applications.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Community Governance</h2>
			<p class="small">The Particl platform is governed exclusively by its community and no central authority, including the Particl Foundation and developing team, possess any kind of decisional power as it relates to activities happening within the platform. Particl's marketplace does not have any rule on what can be listed, it is instead being moderated entirely by the stakers who need to flag inappropriate content. Particl takes the power back into people's hands!
