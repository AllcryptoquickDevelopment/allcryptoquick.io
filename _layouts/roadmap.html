              Bulletproofs are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that require no trusted setup. They are designed to enable efficient Confidential Transactions (CT), and thus RingCT, effectively reducing their transaction size by about ~80%. We estimate the research, development, implementation, and testing to take around 3 to 4 months as a part-time assignment for Tecnovert, our Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer.
