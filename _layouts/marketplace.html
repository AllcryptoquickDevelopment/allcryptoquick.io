      <p>
        The Particl Open Marketplace is a first of its kind market network for the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> technology, it operates with no central authority or middleman and is exclusively owned and operated by its network of users; enabling new exciting possibilities that could not be covered by any previous marketplaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Particl is also scalable, fast, secure and private.</strong> You can buy and sell your favorite product directly for cryptocurrencies, knowing that others canâ€™t monitor your activity.
