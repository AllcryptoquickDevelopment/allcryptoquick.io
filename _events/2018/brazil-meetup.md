Fellow crypto enthusiasts of São Paulo, let us come together October 5th for drinks and discussions at Duna’s Bar!

The main topic of for the evening will be the privacy platform, Particl (PART) which has built a private, decentralized marketplace that is currently in Alpha testing mode. The use cases for this type of Dapp, especially in our region, are really exciting so be prepared for a lively discussion.
