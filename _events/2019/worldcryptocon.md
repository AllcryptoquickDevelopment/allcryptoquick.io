Vegas’ World CryptoCon (WCC), one of the major US-based blockchain conferences of the year and the main event of the Vegas Blockchain Week, is happening just a day after Particl’s presence at Money20/20. It’s also in the same city (Las Vegas). The Particl team is going to seize this opportunity and have its team members that went to Money20/20 to continue their networking at WCC.

Some of the companies and businesses present at Money20/20 are expected to also attend WCC, which will allow the team to continue some of the discussions started the day before and set follow-up meetings with different parties. It’ll be a great opportunity to meet people that are also going to be at SFBW and get them to pass by the Particl booth at SFBW’s Epicenter event and attend Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe’s (Joskye/Kapoor) talk on Particl.
