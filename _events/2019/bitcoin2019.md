Fresh from Particl’s trip to New York for the NYC Blockchain Week, the team is ready to travel the world once again and attend the Bitcoin2019 conference in San Francisco on the 25th and 26th of June 2019.

This time, the conference will be attended by Lina Seiche, Joe Fisher, and Cryptoguard. Make sure to let them know if you’re also attending and would like to meet them!

> After 10 years of evolution, hacks, scams, civil war and breakthroughs, it’s time to think about where Bitcoin will go in the next decade. This will be the return of Bitcoin’s annual conference, an event to push innovation forward, collaborate with old and new friends and reignite the community of permissionless value. — [Bitcoin2019](https://www.bitcoin2019conference.com/)
