The San Francisco Blockchain Week (SFBW) is one of the most important blockchain events of 2019 and, for this reason, **around 12 Particl representatives will be present to attend**. And if a lesson can be learned from previous conferences where Particl had a booth, there will be little to no rest time for any of these team members. It’s no secret, San Francisco is the world’s biggest incubator of tech companies, and so this Blockchain Week is going to be attracting an impressive number of people and companies looking for new and innovative blockchain opportunities to leverage.

For this year’s edition of SFBW’s Epicenter, **Particl is going to be having a large booth for a duration of two days**. The team is also going to give a talk its Open Marketplace and breakdown all of its benefits for individuals and businesses alike on the **“Industry Stage” at 11:30 am on the 1st of November**. Don’t miss this talk as it is expected to contain a few…crunchy insights and information. Fortunately, you shouldn’t worry too much about missing it if you can’t make it to the conference as the full video of the talk will be published online shortly after.

Not only is the entire San Francisco Blockchain Week, with all of its events, side-events, and after-parties, the ideal opportunity to show Particl to all sorts of individuals (B2C and C2C users), but it’s also the perfect moment to get it in front of the right businesses that are hungry about leveraging new innovations to optimize what they have to offer.
