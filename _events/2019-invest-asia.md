Whether you're based in San Francisco or Singapore, there is no escaping how big a role Asia plays in today's crypto markets. Whether it's the advent of exchange tokens, the importance of Asian OTC desks, or the unusually clear-eyed regulatory regimes, there is a strong argument that, when it comes to crypto, in many ways East is leading West.

Invest: Asia is an exploration of the people and topics driving this market. CoinDesk is thrilled to be returning as a partner to TechXLR8 Asia by co-locating Invest: Asia with 5G Asia, IoT World Asia, NV&SDN, the AI Summit and Startup Elevate Asia September 11-12, 2019 at the Marina Bay Sands Convention Center. With a dynamic expo floor, a special Asia edition of CoinDesk Live and plentiful networking opportunities, Invest: Asia will further explore how Asian crypto markets function and impact the world at large.
