Put your thick skin on and get your best arguments ready, it’s time for Manila’s first Crypto Debating Club by BlockChats, SCI, and Particl at BlockchainSPACE!

You will be teaming up with your fellow attendees to battle alongside (or against) four Manila community favourites in a discussion round on the topic:
You don’t need a Blockchain – Change my Mind.

Has the term “Blockchain” been shamelessly overhyped, and if so, what is it actually good for? Are most advertised use cases nothing but nonsense? Or is blockchain technology falsely being demonised and, in reality, useful for much more than just finance? What is YOUR opinion?
